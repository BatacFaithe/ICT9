       <h1> A Reminiscence</h1>
       <h3> By Richard O. Moore<h3>
    </div>
    <div class="Paragraphs">
        <p id="para1">Held in a late season<br>
       At a shifting of worlds,<br>
       In the golden balance of autumn,<br>
       Out of love and reason</p>
        
        <p>We made our peace;<br>
       Stood still in October<br>
       <p style="blue">In the failing light and sought,</p><br>
       Each in the other, ease</p>
        
        <p>And release from silence,<br>
       From the slow damnation<br>
       Of speech that is weak<br>
       And falls from silence.</p>
        
        <p>In the October sun<br>
       By the green river we spoke,<br>
       Late in October, the leaves<br> 
       Of the water maples had fallen.</p>
        
        <p class="para4">But whatever we said<br>
       In the bright leaves was lost,<br>
       Quick as the leaf-fall,<br>
       Brittle and blood red.</p>
