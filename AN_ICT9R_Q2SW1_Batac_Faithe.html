   <tr><p id="para1" style="color: dark brown">The golden retriever is one of the most popular dog breeds in the U.S.—for good reason.<br> They are &lt;simultaneously wonderful family pets—thanks to their friendly, tolerant attitude—and capable, intelligent working dogs.&gt;<br> These sturdy, medium-sized dogs grow to about 55–75 pounds and typically live to be about 10–12 years old.<br> Outgoing, trustworthy, eager-to-please, and easy-to-train, they are especially popular with families with young children.<br> Goldens often maintain their fun-loving puppy attitudes and signature smile into adulthood.<br>Part of the sporting dog group, golden retrievers are active dogs that require at least an hour of daily exercise.<br> They live up to their name; they love retrieving just about anything thrown for them.<br> This makes them excellent hunting companions and skilled service dogs.<br> They love to eat, run, spend time with their owners, and even participate in obedience and agility events.</td></p>

   <tr><p id="para2" style="color:darkbrown">Labrador Retriever, also called Labrador and Lab, breed of sporting dog that originated in Newfoundland and was brought to England by fishermen about 1800.<br> It is an outstanding gun dog, consistently dominating field trials.<br> Standing 21.5 to 24.5 inches (55 to 62 cm) tall at the withers and weighing 55 to 80 pounds (25 to 36 kg), it is more solidly built than other retrievers and has shorter legs.<br> Distinctive features include its otterlike tail, thick at the base and tapered toward the end, and its short dense coat of black, brown (“chocolate”), or yellow.<br> The Labrador Retriever is characteristically rugged, even-tempered, and gentle.<br> It has been used in military and police work, as a rescue dog, and as a guide dog for the blind.<br> &lt;An ideal family pet, the Labrador Retriever became in the 1990s the most popular dog breed in the United States.&gt;</td></p>
